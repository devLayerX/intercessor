// strict_types is intentionally absent here. $wpdb returns all column values
// as strings regardless of the underlying MySQL column type. With strict_types
// enabled, assigning a string to a typed `int` or `float` property on a Row
// subclass throws a TypeError before the subclass constructor can run its
// explicit casts. Without strict_types, PHP coerces scalar strings to their
// declared type automatically ("42" → 42, "1.5" → 1.5), which is exactly the
// behaviour needed. Subclasses may still declare strict_types=1 in their own
// files — that declaration only applies to the file it appears in.
